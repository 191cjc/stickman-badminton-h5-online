# DOM and Canvas components

## Composition

The page is static [HTML](../../../index.html) with DOM coordination in [main.ts](../../../src/client/main.ts). There is no component framework, custom hook system, or global state library. Keep behavior in the existing controller classes and use the central scene helpers (`overlay`, `buttons`, `labels`, `updateHud`) for consistent UI transitions.

The local element lookup checks presence and uses a generic assertion:

```typescript
function el<T extends HTMLElement>(id: string): T {
  const value = document.getElementById(id);
  if (!value) throw new Error(`Missing element: ${id}`);
  return value as T;
}
```

Its generic does not validate the tag at runtime. When changing an element ID/type, update HTML and all typed lookups together. Use `textContent` for status/message text and the `hidden` property for visibility, matching existing helpers; do not interpolate network text into HTML.

## Canvas presentation

[Renderer.render](../../../src/client/renderer.ts) consumes `GameState` and `Viewport`; it hydrates reusable `Player`/`Shuttlecock` objects to use geometry methods. Renderer must not decide collisions, scores, room status, or gameplay input.

The frame loop measures Canvas CSS dimensions, caps DPR at 2, calculates a uniform world scale, and sets the drawing transform. Preserve the 1600x900 world mapping from [config.ts](../../../src/shared/config.ts) rather than changing physics coordinates to fit the screen.

## Styling and accessibility

Use the existing global [CSS](../../../src/client/style.css), semantic buttons, Chinese labels, labeled Canvas, labeled directional touch buttons, and live match-status region. `[hidden]` must remain effective despite layout rules. Keep visible action buttons keyboard accessible and maintain their disabled/visibility rules across scene changes.

Canvas is focusable; matching explicitly focuses it. Touch buttons keep pointer cancellation handling described in [event lifecycle](event-lifecycle.md). Visual scaling and actual keyboard/touch behavior require manual browser verification; type checking alone cannot prove them.
